<h2>Usability Story: A Bus Ride to Empathy</h2>
<p>Panic.</p>
<p>The windows of the bus were impossible to see through. The interior was fogged with humidity as the heat strained against the determined clutches of winter. The exterior glass was coated in a thick film of road salt. It was early April in Ottawa, Ontario &mdash; snow was still falling, and winter tires would remain on most cars until May, when the weather warmed above freezing.</p>
<p>At the front of the bus, a digital sign &mdash; which normally beamed with bright yellow letters identifying the current route, next stop, and time &mdash; was dark. The voice system, an alternative to the visual aid, was also silent.</p>
<p>To add to my confusion, I was also a newcomer to Canada, a recently landed immigrant still learning the lay of the land. This was one of my first trips on the public transit system, and I was still learning the bus stops and routes that would take me to and from work every day.</p>
<p>I had found the <a href="http://www.octranspo.com/accessibility/next_stop_announcement_system_nsas">Next Stop Announcement System (NSAS)</a> on other buses around the city particularly helpful, and without it to guide me or the ability to see out the window to my stop, I felt as if a small part of my independence had been stripped away, crippled by the utmost (somewhat ridiculously) coincidental of circumstances. Unable to use my sense of sight or hearing to determine my location, I felt, in a sense, <em>impaired</em>. </p>
<p>There are three categories of impairments to consider when developing for accessibility &mdash; permanent, temporary, and situational. In that moment, at a loss for my location on this new bus route, I was experiencing a situational impairment &mdash; a loss of ability (in this case, my sense of direction) due to this series of overlapping inconveniences.</p>
<p>I felt an acute sense of helplessness, coupled with a sudden awareness that this type of anxiety or annoyance might exist on a more regular basis for those whose one or more senses or cognitive abilities are less than perfect (or may be completely absent, in the case of the blind or deaf).</p>
<p>The system eventually turned on about halfway through my route, much to my relief, and I was able to get off the bus at my proper stop, foggy and filthy windows notwithstanding. But as I came back to my senses (no pun intended), I imagined myself in the shoes of someone less able-bodied than me. </p>
<p>Of course, there was a time before this audio and visual announcement system existed. Ottawa's announcement system was not implemented until 2010. Even today, some cities do not have a system like this at all, and stops may or may not be announced verbally by the bus driver. </p>
<p>But in experiencing this strange set of circumstances first-hand, I had to wonder: how might someone who was visually, hearing, or cognitively impaired have felt? Anxious? Confused? Angry? Annoyed? How did their experience on public transit change with the implementation of these accessible systems?</p>
<p>I later saw this experience as a learning opportunity to explore a topic that is at the forefront of usability and accessibility best practices: empathy.</p>
<h2>This Is Empathy</h2>
<p>This feeling I experienced was empathy &mdash; imagining how another might feel and sharing those feelings. The idiom "walk a mile in their shoes" is an apt description often use to describe empathy. The original phrase was taken from an 1895 Mary T. Lathrap poem, <em>Judge Softly</em>, later renamed <em>Walk a Mile in His Moccasins</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  Just walk a mile in his moccasins<br />
  Before you abuse, criticize and accuse.<br />
  If just for one hour, you could find a way<br />
  To see through his eyes, instead of your own muse.
</blockquote>
<p>Indi Young, a renowned qualitative data scientist, researcher, and author, describes two kinds of empathy in her presentation, <a href="https://indiyoung.com/conference-presentation-practical-empathy/">Practical Empathy</a>: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. </p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"With cognitive empathy it's purposeful. I <em>want to</em> understand this other person. You have an intent to understand the other person. With emotional empathy, it's <em>reflexive</em>. Emotional empathy is something that happens to you."</blockquote>
<p>My experience on the bus was an instant of emotional empathy &mdash; something that <em>happened to me</em> &mdash; that led me to thinking about my situation outside of myself. This brought about a state of cognitive empathy: a want to understand how someone with different abilities might feel in a particular situation.</p>
<h2>Why should apply empathy to accessibility?</h2>
<p>In the end, it all comes down to the fact that we are all human, with our own aspirations, frustrations, skills, and flaws. Though I hail from a background in software, really any product or service that can be used by another person to accomplish a goal, from websites to <a href="http://disability-marketing.com/2013/11/11/oxo-getting-grip-usability/">vegetable peelers</a>, can be approached with empathy, because there is an end-user in mind &mdash; a person and an interaction. </p>
<p>There are several arguments to be made here regarding the <em>why </em>of empathy in a general sense, whether you're talking about usability or accessibility or, to use a more recent term, inclusive design (which in itself will be the topic of a future post). This is not an exhaustive list, but a springboard for discussion. Among them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monetary reasons: You want to improve sales, boost numbers, and be able to afford to continue running your business. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competition: If your users don't like your product or service, they'll go elsewhere to find something that better meets their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal issues: You want to avoid being sued due to a lack of government-enforced accessibility compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral compulsion: As a fellow human being, it's simply the right thing to do to understand the needs of your users and empower them to accomplish their goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, the last point &mdash; morality &mdash; stands out the most. I want to enable people, to enrich their lives through the use of technology. Helping one another is vital part of the human condition, and this is what originally drew me to the web as a career path.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="mb-0">Essentially the message is to really try to <em>care</em> about the people that you're serving, that you're supporting, as humans. To pay more attention. To gather their thoughts and use that in that little spark when you're doing your brainstorming. Keep that as ... a continual part of the way that you are making things."</p>

<h2>How can we develop empathy in order to better understand accessibility?</h2>
<p>Listen. Learn. Understand.</p>
<p>Be informed about your user base &mdash; and, if you can, get out there and talk to them! When you are unsure about a direction to take a design or if the product you have developed may be difficult to use, your best course of action is to reach out to real users for feedback. </p>
<p>However, as far as accessibility is concerned, it can be a little harder to find and talk directly to your users who have special needs. The next best thing you can do is to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/">learn about the types of disabilities and the challenges that come with each</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/tools-techniques/">tools that people with disabilities use to navigate the web</a>. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that part of this process may require a shift of thinking. One may assume that the assistive technology limits an individual with special needs in what the tool can accomplish when using a certain product, but it is actually the opposite &mdash; it is really the product creating the barrier, not the person or the technology.

<p>What can we do to better understand these barriers and how to break them down?</p>
<p>In the case of web development, we can develop empathy by understanding (at least on a basic level) how assistive technologies work and trying to use them ourselves. Browse your website with a screen reader, attempt to navigate your computer or phone using speech recognition, or experiment with magnification software. You could also try using your computer without a mouse, or one of the many other activities suggested on the <a href="http://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.php">Participation page for Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to develop empathy that is commonly used in the user experience field is to create a persona &mdash; a named, fictional character used to represent real users, based on existing research and analytics. This can help you pin down the motivations and challenges of potential users of your site and help to remind you to place people first. 
<p>In Sarah Horton and Whitney Quesenbery's book, <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/">A Web For Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences</a>, eight personas helped to form a solid grounding in accessibility principles by explaining the benefits of each principle a personal level. By sharing the perspective of each persona, Horton and Quesenbery helped to form a human connection between the reader and people with special needs whom the reader might serve through the web.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Empathy is a core concept in the study of usability and accessibility, and it is one that every department in an organization should take into account. The easiest way to develop empathy is to place yourself in another's shoes by learning their tools and understanding their everyday goals and challenges.</p>
